      <description>&lt;p&gt;![The image shows a three-dimensional cube with various images and texts on its sides. On the top side, there is a photograph of an old red car parked in front of a building. Below this photo, there’s a smaller image depicting a person wearing a suit and tie, standing next to a brick wall. The text on this side reads “André Breton 1967.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the left side, there is an image of a night sky with stars, which appears to be a painting or illustration rather than a photograph. Below this artwork, there’s a smaller photo of a person wearing a dark jacket and standing in front of a building at night. The text on this side reads “Kerouac et Patti Smith 1970.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>
