Welcome! I'm Gail, a technical writer and developer living and working on planet Earth.

I'm passionate about self-directed learning, sustainability, and FOSS.

This is my digital garden - a collection of ideas, notes, scraps, poems, scripts, maps, pictures, logs, learnings, bits, chips, pieces, graphs, snacks, books, tables, videos, crafts, links, quotes, stories, questions, answers, algorithms, designs, projects, problems, solutions, news, ontologies, methods, portals, shortcuts, docs, thoughts, code samples, cats, doodles, observations, snippets, pathways, patterns, curiosities, mementos, marvels, collections, records, excerpts, chronicles, concepts, wonders and whatnots hosted on the World Wide Web. 

I mostly write about hypermedia, semantic networks, and bricolage.

Enjoy exploring.
